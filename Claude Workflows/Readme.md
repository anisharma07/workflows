## 🔐 Required Secrets

All workflows require the following GitHub secrets to be configured:

| Secret                  | Description                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`     | AWS access key for Bedrock access                                 |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS secret key for Bedrock access                                 |
| `AWS_REGION`            | AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`)                                    |
| `AWS_BEDROCK_MODEL_ID`  | Claude model ID (e.g., `anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0`) |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`          | GitHub personal access token (automatically provided)             |

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Configure AWS Bedrock:** Ensure you have access to Claude models in AWS Bedrock
2. **Set Repository Secrets:** Add all required secrets in repository settings
3. **Enable Actions:** Ensure GitHub Actions are enabled for your repository
4. **Grant Permissions:** Workflows need write access to contents, pull requests, and issues

## 📝 Notes

- All workflows create separate branches for their changes to maintain clean git history
- Existing branches are automatically cleaned up before creating new ones
- Pull requests are created automatically for review and merging
- Workflows are designed to be safe and non-destructive to your main codebase

## 🤝 Contributing

When modifying workflows:

1. Test changes in a fork first
2. Ensure all required secrets are properly configured
3. Update this documentation for any new features
4. Follow the existing patterns for consistency
